This information is often collected through links. Unfortunately, we face an on-going problem: we collect links in assorted places for personal use, making them difficult to access when needed and hidden from others who can find value in them. There is social anxiety associated with sharing information on the internet. When sharing links people are concerned about:</p><p class="info sub">Their identity being associated with the controversial information they share.</p><p class="info sub">Bothering others.</p><p class="info sub">Receiving acceptance.</p><p class="info">These issues create a gap between people and those who can find value in the information they are gathering. Neat aims to remove the social anxiety that correlates with sharing information on the internet. Our mission is to create a judgement free network for people who love sharing useful information on the internet. This case study outlines the creation of Neat as a Product Designer.</p></div><div id="info-container"><div class="title-container"><p class="info-title">Initial Form</p></div><p class="info">Neat underwent several iterations before arriving at its current form. The first experience was comprised of a feed where users could create multiple boards in which links could be sorted. This failed. Users found the experience difficult to grok. Users were able to access multiple boards at once while saving, as a result they would save links to the boards that seemed most convenient. User's boards became cluttered and impossible to navigate.</p><p class="info">We then stripped away complexity and distilled the experience to one linear feed. As a result link saving and revisiting increased. So we added additional requested features such as an overlay for instant revisting. A browser extension for faster saving on the web. A masonry grid, for quicker consumption. A list view for users who wanted to see more metadata associated with their items, in addition to quicker editing.</p></div><div id="initial"><img class="initial-image" src="images/neat-1.png"></div><div id="info-container"><div class="title-container"><p class="info-title">Information Architecture</p></div><p class="info">In order to understand the best approach for the next iteration of neat, I conducted information architecture to understand how a link relates to a user. Links exist within collections that are created by a user. A user's profile contains all of the collections and links they have accumulated. In the first release "Home Room", is the collection for all links on Neat.</p></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">Gathering information is an inherent habit of human nature. Our goal is to build a product that facilitates this habit. Nir Eyal discusses the process of creating habit forming products through the "hooked cycle". This cycle follows trigger, action, variable reward and investment. Based on feedback we identified how neat fits each criteria of the cycle.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Internal trigger</b> ~ The fear of losing valuable info.</p><p class="info sub"><b>External trigger</b> ~ The need to capture links.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Action</b> ~ The user capturing links by saving.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Variable Reward</b> ~ Users saving one anothers links.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Investment</b> ~ Forming collection of links.</p><p class="info no">With the initial experience, we made it seamless for users to save links, therefore, we satisfied their triggers and action. The new challenge was to build an experience that satisfied their variable reward and investment in order to complete the full cycle.</p><p class="info">After further interviews with users we were able to understand how to frame our experience. Profiles needed to be private because people do not want to be judged for what they are saving. In addition people want to categorize the content they find.</p></div><div id="initial"><img class="initial-image" src="images/useflow.png"></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">In our first release of neat V1.0, we are focusing on allowing user's to collect and discover new information from others are users through "Home Room". This userflow illustrates how neat's updated user experience facilitates a user exploring new links from the community and contributing on mobile web.</p></div><div id="video-container"><div class="title-container"><p class="info-title">Testing Testing Testing</p></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">I used framer.js to create high fidelity prototypes to guide the development of the web version of neat.</p></div><div id="video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/home-feed.mp4"><source src="images/home-feed.webm"></video></div></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">I simplified the navigation into three components; "Home Room", "Add" and "Profile". Home Room is where all of posts from the community exist. Everytime a user saves a link to their collection, it is surfaced in Home Room. All posts in Home Room are anonymous. Profile is where all of the users assorted links exist. Users cannot visit one anothers profile. People said that they remember content based on significant events or days so we segmented links by day. Additionaly, we switched to a full screen overlay for better fitting embeds.</p></div><div id="video-container"><div id="video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/overlays.mp4"><source src="images/overlays.webm"></video></div></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">Overall users found navigating from Home Room to their profile easy. They had a good understanding of where posts are coming from and how theirs relate to others. We noticed that people naturally try to swipe through posts and use the arrow keys as a secondary option.</p></div><div id="mobile-video-container"><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/overlay-mobile.mp4"><source src="images/overlay-mobile.webm"></video></div><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/neat-proto.mp4"><source src="images/neat-proto.webm"></video></div></div><div id="info-container"><div class="title-container new"><p class="info-title">New Form</p></div></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">As we continues to test Neat, we noticed that users had a difficult time distinguishing where each item ended relative to the next. In addition to differentiating each date segment. I added of white backgrounds on each item serving as a picture frame. This helped users identify how large each item is and also created room for the features such as the delete button and player icon.</p></div><div id="mobile-video-container"><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/neat-mobile-web.mp4"><source src="images/neat-mobile-web.webm"></video></div><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/neat-mobile-profile-web.mp4"><source src="images/neat-mobile-profile-web.webm"></video></div></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">Through the course of the design of neat, the goal is to keep the experience utilitarian. As we receive feedback we will role out new features that don't disrupt the overall purpose of the product. Users have primarily asked for collections amongst other requests.</p></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">Collections will complete the habit cycle for neat, fulfilling the users "investment". Collections aim to give users the ability to gather relevant links and share them as a method to display curated lists of useful information. They will take the form of a permalink so users are able to view them without logging. Others can ask to contribute to a collection which triggers sign up. Users will have the ability to embed them on other webpages.</p></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">This is an ongoing project, more information coming soon.
