           We consistently find valuable information from across the internet.
           This information is often collected through links. Unfortunately,
           we face an on-going problem: we collect links in assorted places for personal use,
           making them difficult to acces when needed and hidden from others who can find value in them.
           Sharing information creates social anxiety. When sharing links people
           are concerned about:
         </p>
         <p class="info sub">
           Their identity being associated with the controversial information they share.
         </p>
         <p class="info sub">
           Bothering others.
         </p>
         <p class="info sub">
           Receiving a lack of adoration.
         </p>
         <p class="info">
          These issues create a gap between people and those who can find value
          in the information they are gathering. Neat aims to remove the social anxiety that correlates
          with sharing information on the internet. Our mission is to create a judgement free
          network for people who love sharing useful information on the internet.
          This case study outlines the creation of Neat as a Product Designer.

          <p class="info">
            Neat underwent several iterations before arriving at its current form. The first experience was comprised of a feed where users could
            create multiple boards in which links could be sorted. This failed. Users found the experience difficult to grok. Users were able to access
            multiple boards at once while saving, as a result they would save links to the boards that seemed most convenient. As a result user's boards became cluttered and impossible to navigate.
          </p>
          <p class="info">
            We then stripped away complexity and distilled the experience to one linear feed.
            As a result link saving and revisiting increased. So we added additional requested features such as an overlay for instant
            revisting. A browser extension for faster saving on the web. A masonry grid, for quicker consumption.
            A list view for users who wanted to see more metadata associated with their items, in addition to quicker editing.

            In order to understand the best approach for the next iteration of neat, I conducted information architecture to understand how a link relates to a user. Links exist within
            collections that are created by a user. A user's profile contains all of the collections and links they have accumulated.
            "Home Room", is the collection for all information on Neat.

            Saving is an inherent habit to human nature, whether for digital or physical objects. Our goal is to build a product
            that facilitates this habit. Nir Eyal discusses the process of creating habit forming products through the "hooked cycle". This
            cycle follows trigger, action, variable reward and investment. Based on feedback we identified how neat
            fits each criteria of the cycle.
          </p>
          <p class="info sub">
            <b>Internal trigger</b> ~ The fear of losing valuable info.
          </p>
          <p class="info sub">
            <b>External trigger</b> ~ The need to capture links.
          </p>
          <p class="info sub">
            <b>Action</b> ~ The user capturing links by saving.
          </p>
          <p class="info sub">
            <b>Variable Reward</b> ~ Users saving one anothers links.
          </p>
          <p class="info sub">
            <b>Investment</b> ~ Forming collection of links.
          </p>
          <p class="info no">
            With the initial experience, we made it
            seamless for users to save links, therefore we satisfied their triggers and action. The new challenge
            was to build an experience that satisfied their variable reward and investment in order to complete the full
            cycle.

          <p class="info">
            After further interviews with users we were able to understand how to frame our experience.
            Profiles needed to be private because people do not want to be judged for what they are saving.
            In addition people want to categorize the content they find.

            In our first release of neat V1.0, we are focusing on allowing user's to save and discover
            new information what others are saving. This useflow illustrates how neat's updated user experience
            facilitates this on mobile web.

          I simplified the navigation into three components; "Home Room", "Add" and "Profile". Home Room is where all of
          posts from the community exist. Everytime a user saves a link to their collection, it is surfaced in Home Room. Users can then
          save links from other users in Home Room to their profile. All posts in Home Room are anonymous. Profile is where all of the users assorted links exist.
          Users cannot visit one anothers profile. We made all posts square so posts can fit comfortably in each
          container. Users said that they remember content based on significant events or days
          so we segmented links by day. Additionaly, we switched to a full screen overlay for better fitting embeds.

          I used sketch to design the experience and Framer.js to create high fidelity prototypes for mobile.
          We used the prototypes to test how people would interact with the mobile web version of Neat. Specifically to
          understand how people navigate between the Home Room ("Explore" in this prototype), posts and their profile.
          We noticed that people naturally try to swipe through posts and use the arrow keys as a secondary option.

          Through the course of the design of neat, the goal is to keep the experience utilitarian. As we receive feedback we will role out new features
          that don't disrupt the overall purpose of the product. Users have primarily asked for collections.
          Thus we are working on giving users the ability to create collections of links that are accessible through Home Room.
          Other features such as linking items from Home Room to personal feeds
          will be coming soon.

            Collections, aim to give users the ability to gather relevant links and share them as a method to display curated lists of useful information.
            They will take form of a permalink so users are able to view them without logging. Others can ask to contribute to a collection
            which triggers sign up. They will be embeddable so users can add them to their webpages and share them
            on other platforms.
