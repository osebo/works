With a redefined brand statement Tumblr has been focusing on making the platform a home for various interest groups to connect with one another through conversation around content. Unfortunately, there is no structure for communities to engage with one another on Tumblr.</p><p class="info">From research to high fidelity prototyping, during the Summer of 2017, I worked on Tumblr’s three-person (including myself) product design team, under the creative direction of Neil Voss to create “Tumblr Groups” ~ communities for interest groups on Tumblr.</p><p class="info sub">This is my Tumblr ~ <a href="http://osebo.tumblr.com" class="link" target="_blank">osebo.tumblr.com</a></p></div><div id="info-container"><div class="title-container"><p class="info-title">Methods of Communication</p></div><p class="info">Communication on Tumblr exists within many forms. We conducted research to understand how interest groups currently communicate with one another on Tumblr. Methods include tagging, reblogging, and direct messaging.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Tags</b> - Allow users to group their posts with similar ones. Tags are currently surfaced on individual posts and the explore page.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Reblogs</b> - Allow users to repost another user’s content to their blog. Users are able to add text or images to a post through reblogs. This often starts “reblog chains”.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Direct messaging</b> - One to one chatting between users. Users are able to share posts, in addition to images and gifs.</p><p class="info">These methods are not sufficient means to support communities within the platform. Tags do not efficiently group similar content, making it hard for interest groups to connect with one another. Reblog chains are difficult to follow and grouped under the vague term “notes” (which also include replies and likes). Direct messaging does not enable more than two users to participate in a conversation.</p></div><div id="info-container"><div class="title-container"><p class="info-title">Taxonomy and Definitions</p></div><p class="info">With the creation of Groups, various terms needed clarity. We then created a lexicon defining 'account,' 'profile,' 'group,' and 'Tumblr (blog)'. These terms help to map each level of hierarchy and determine where Groups can exist:</p><p class="info sub"><b>Account</b> - A user’s credentials for login, recovery, support and additional information linked to the human using Tumblr.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Profile</b> - An index for blogs and Groups associated with an account ~ a user’s identity on Tumblr.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Groups</b> - A collaborative area to share and discuss content regarding an overarching topic, with others who have similar interests.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Tumblr</b> - A user’s feed of posts. Tumblrs can differentiate based on interests, and serve as a user's identity ~ Replacing the word blog (an outdated term).</p><p class="info">In Tumblr 2.0 an account can create multiple profiles that exist at the same level. Currently, users can create primary and secondary blogs. However, they do not have the same functionality. Users cannot like or follow from their secondary blog, amongst many other issues that users consistently voice. All profiles existing on the same level removes the primary and secondary blog conundrum. Profiles can have multiple Tumblrs and Groups. Likes, followers, following, Tumblrs and Groups all exist within its assigned profile.</p></div><div id="initial"><img class="initial-image" src="images/taxonomy-map.png"></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">To understand how a user could discover Groups from posts, the dashboard, and explore feed I created numerous wireframes. I hypothesized that Groups should inherently be private. Tumblr users predominantly use pseudo aliases to form their identity. This means it is difficult to connect with other users. Thus, users will favor creating smaller private Groups amongst other users they are familiar with. However, they will have the ability to make their group public.</p></div><div id="initial"><img class="initial-image" src="images/ia-image.png"></div><div id="info-container"><div class="title-container"><p class="info-title">Groups Interface</p></div><p class="info">The goal for Tumblr Groups is to help new and existing users engage more in conversations around content by directing them into interest-based spaces. Two of the experiences we explored for Groups included; a hybrid between a Tumblr (blog) and a conversation, and one that is a feed of dynamic posts submitted by group members. We conducted user testing to validate our assumptions. I built high fidelity prototypes using Framer.js. We created various Groups in each version of the prototype to display the diversity of content that can be shared.</p></div><div id="mobile-video-container"><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/group-convo-proto.mp4"><source src="images/group-convo-proto.webm"></video><p class="proto-description">Blog/convo concept</p></div><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/group-post-proto.mp4"><source src="images/group-post-proto.webm"></video><p class="proto-description">Group blog concept</p></div></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">User testing participants found the blog/convo Groups concept more compelling. Users could share images, text, gifs, videos, drawings, and links. Chat bubbles and all forms of multimedia can be tapped and expanded into posts that can be liked, reblogged, replied to or shared. Posts exist within their individual Groups but can also be shared between them.</p></div><div class="mobile-image-container"><img class="post-image" src="images/more-1.png"> <img class="post-image" src="images/more-2.png"> <img class="post-image" src="images/more-3.png"></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">We explored giving users the ability to draw or add an emoji on another user's post. We prototyped using the swipe up gesture on a post to surface tags, related posts and other Groups the post has been shared in. Alternatively, the swipe up gesture could also be used as a method to view a post's replies.</p></div><div id="mobile-video-container"><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/reply-proto.mp4"><source src="images/reply-proto.webm"></video><p class="proto-description">Reply and reblog interaction</p></div><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/press-like-proto.mp4"><source src="images/press-like-proto.webm"></video><p class="proto-description">Fast reblog interaction</p></div></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">Replies can also be surfaced by tapping the reply icon. Users can instantly like by double tapping a post. The long press gesture could be used for fast reblog within a feed of posts such as a dashboard or explore feed. Long pressing on a post that has expanded allows users to add a drawing, image and/or text on top of a post for reblogging or sharing.</p><p class="info">Users found smaller Groups of roughly 20 or fewer members more compelling for the blog/conversation hybrid concept. Users were afraid that larger public Groups could suffer from spam. However, they believed that the group blog concept could be suitable for Groups with hundreds of members. Despite the concern, users were pleased by Tumblr's new post design.</p></div><div id="info-container"><div class="title-container"><p class="info-title">A New Post Format</p></div><p class="info">With the creation of Groups, we sought to make Tumblr a more immersive experience for returning and new users. Adding the tap through post interaction kept users more engaged. Terms that often confused users were "notes" and "reblogs". Notes are used to display metrics for likes and reblogs, but also act as a gateway to replies. Reblog is an unfamiliar term to new users, especially for those of a younger demographic.</p><p class="info">I removed the term notes on expanded posts and provided the metrics for replies, likes and reblogs next to its appropriate icon. To satisfy power users, notes would exist on a post within a feed to indicate that there are metrics to view.</p></div><div class="mobile-image-container"><img class="post-image" src="images/post1.png"> <img class="post-image" src="images/post2.png"> <img class="post-image" src="images/post3.png"> <img class="post-image" src="images/post4.png"> <img class="post-image" src="images/post5.png"> <img class="post-image" src="images/post6.png"> <img class="post-image" src="images/post7.png"> <img class="post-image" src="images/post8.png"></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">Tumblr's new post format utilizes the updated color palette with solid colors and gradients.
