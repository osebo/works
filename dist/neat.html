This information is often collected through links. Unfortunately, we face an on-going problem: we collect links in assorted places for personal use, making them difficult to access when needed and hidden from others who can find value in them. We use social networks to share this information with a larger community. However, there is social anxiety associated with sharing information on the internet. When sharing links people are concerned about:</p><p class="info sub">Their identity being associated with the controversial information they share.</p><p class="info sub">Bothering others.</p><p class="info sub">Receiving acceptance.</p><p class="info">These issues create a gap between people and those who can find value in the information they are gathering. Neat aims to remove the social anxiety that correlates with sharing information on the internet. Our mission is to create a judgment free network for organizing the internet. This case study discusses the creation of Neat as the Product Designer.</p></div><div id="info-container"><div class="title-container"><p class="info-title">Initial Form</p></div><p class="info">Neat underwent several iterations before arriving at its current form. The first experience was comprised of a feed where users could create multiple boards in which links could be sorted. This failed. Users found the experience difficult to grok. Since they were able to access multiple boards at once while saving, they always saved links to the boards that seemed most convenient.</p><p class="info">We then stripped away complexity and distilled the experience to one linear feed. As a result, link saving and revisiting increased. Then we added additional requested features such as an overlay for instant revisiting. A browser extension for faster saving on the web. A masonry grid, for quicker consumption. A list view for users who wanted to see more metadata associated with their items.</p></div><div id="initial"><img class="initial-image" src="images/neat-1.png"></div><div id="info-container"><div class="title-container"><p class="info-title">Know the User</p></div><p class="info">Gathering information is an inherent habit of human nature. Our goal is to build a product that facilitates this habit. In the book "Hooked", Nir Eyal discusses the process of creating habit forming products through the "Hooked Cycle". This cycle follows trigger, action, variable reward and investment. I interviewed users to understand how Neat fits each criteria of the cycle. Their answers formed these conclusions:</p><p class="info sub"><b>Internal trigger</b> ~ The fear of losing info.</p><p class="info sub"><b>External trigger</b> ~ The need to capture links.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Action</b> ~ The user capturing links by saving.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Variable Reward</b> ~ Users collecting other users links.</p><p class="info sub"><b>Investment</b> ~ Forming collections of links.</p><p class="info no">With the initial experience, we made it seamless for users to capture information, therefore, we satisfied their triggers and action. The new challenge was to build an experience that satisfied their variable reward and investment in order to complete the full cycle.</p><p class="info">After further interviews with users, we were able to understand how to frame our experience. Profiles needed to be private because people do not want to be judged for what they are saving, however, people want to see what others are finding on the internet. Additionally, users want to categorize the information they find.</p></div><div id="initial"><img class="initial-image" src="images/neat-ia.png"></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">In the first release of Neat V1.0, we focused on giving users the ability to collect and explore information from others in the community through "Home Room" ~ the first collection on Neat. This userflow illustrates how Neat's updated experience facilitates a user's journey contributing to the community and exploring new information.</p></div><div id="video-container"><div class="title-container"><p class="info-title">Profile & Explore Visuals</p></div></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">Through iterating on the previous version of the product, I simplified the navigation into three components; "Home Room", "Add" and "Profile". Home Room is where all of the items from the community exist. Every time a user saves a link to their collection, it is surfaced in Home Room. The profile is where all of the user's assorted links exist. Users cannot visit one another's profile because they are inherently private. People said that they remember content based on significant events or days so we segmented links by day. Additionally, we switched to a full-screen overlay for better fitting embeds.</p></div><div id="mobile-video-container"><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/overlay-mobile.mp4"><source src="images/overlay-mobile.webm"></video><p class="proto-description">Swipe through items interaction</p></div><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/neat-proto.mp4"><source src="images/neat-proto.webm"></video><p class="proto-description">Explore feed concept</p></div></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">Overall users found navigating from Home Room to their profile easy. They had a great understanding of where items are coming from and how theirs relate to others'. They felt that adding items to Neat was painless since their identities are not associated with the content they add.</p><p class="info">Users had a difficult time distinguishing their profile from Home Room. Additionally, users found the feed cluttered since there were no constraints on the beginning and end of items. This was a reoccurring problem, predominantly for items that had white or no background. Users also wanted more context to whether an item is a video, music, or web page.</p></div><div id="initial"><img class="initial-image" src="images/neat-web.png"></div><div id="info-container"><div class="title-container new"><p class="info-title">New Form</p></div></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">I added an off-white background to items serving as a picture frame. This helped users identify how large each item is and also created room for others features that relate to items such as the delete button and player icon. We also changed the profile feed of items to a linear one column feed, to help users distinguish Home Room and their profile.</p></div><div id="mobile-video-container"><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/hr-v1-proto.mp4"><source src="images/hr-v1-proto.webm"></video><p class="proto-description">First release explore</p></div><div id="mobile-video-viewport"><video playsinline autoplay loop muted preload width="100%;" height="100%"><source src="images/profile-v1-proto.mp4"><source src="images/profile-v1-proto.webm"></video><p class="proto-description">First release profile</p></div></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">We have successfully shipped the new iteration of Neat. The goal is to keep the experience utilitarian. As we receive feedback we will roll out new features that do not disrupt the overall purpose of the product. Users have been avidly adding links to the community and are primarily asking for collections.</p></div><div id="info-container"><p class="info">This is an ongoing project.
